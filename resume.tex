\section{Experience}

\entry 2012/07-Present @ Waterloo, ON. 2G Robotics Inc.| Sensor Developer/Researcher
\textit{\\2G Robotics provides a line of underwater laser metrology equipment and imaging solutions to the offshore oil and gas industries.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed and maintained a line of underwater laser scanners and underwater cameras. Responsible for "Full Stack" hardware development (high speed digital and analog electronics design through system level programming and algorithm development).
\item Oversaw several high profile deployments with large oil and gas customers that have led to equipment profiles in several trade journals and the adoption of laser scanning as a standard offshore metrology tool.
\item Mentored new group members and worked in small teams to develop state of the art underwater metrology equipment.
\item Wrote several white papers for internal and external use. Currently hold 1 patent. 
\end{itemize}


\entry 2005/09-2012/07 @ Vancouver, BC. Quantum Materials Group| Researcher
\textit{\\The Quantum Materials Group combines expertise in materials preparation and spectroscopy to further our understanding of correlated electron systems.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed and managed thin film preparation and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy facility. Enabled UBC researchers and their collaborators to quickly prepare and characterize their samples while saving ~\$10K+ per group per year on external lab costs. 
\item Mentored new group members and helped them develop their research goals.
\item Published five research papers in high impact, peer-reviewed journals, wrote two dissertations and presented my work to both technical and general audiences.
\end{itemize}
